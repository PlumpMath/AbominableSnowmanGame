For easier loading from panda, save all maps in this format for now:

Heightmaps: <MAP NAME>-h.png
Textures (colormaps): <MAP NAME>-t.png

For example, a map has a name of "testMap", its two components would be named:
testMap-h.png
testMap-t.png

We can add more map components easily by using a different letter, for instance
-o for Objects
-r for Terrain
etc.
